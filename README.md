  <figcaption>Fitted time-varying meteorological effects on MIR by parasite species. Fitted time-varying meteorological effects due to P.   vivax (red) and P. falciparum (light blue) and their 95% CI (shading of each colored curve). The period shaded in gray represents the   PAMAFRO intervention.</figcaption>
